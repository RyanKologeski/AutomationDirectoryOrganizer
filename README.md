## What is the application?
- The application consists of an executable that organizes a user specified directory, separating the files contained in it by the extension.
## How it works
- The basement of the application consists in a FOR loop. That will catch all files in directory and do Split (split('.')). In this way, we can get the last element of the list, by index -1, and separate the files extension.
- The next step is separate the file in a folder by your extension.
- The program check if the path exist, the folder name is: Folder 'extension'
- If the folder exist, the file is just moved to it. Case it dosenÂ´t exist, the folder is created and file is moved.
